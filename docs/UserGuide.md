## Features

### Start

When you'll open the application, you will be able to see a similar page to the one below

<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartFrame.jpg" alt="Start Page" width="200"/>
</p>

If you touch, the dropdown list on the toolbar, you should see a list of time periods:
<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/TimePeriodList.jpg" alt="Time list" width="200"/>
</p>

### Choose your time period

If you need to look at how much money you saved during a particular time period, just choose it. You will see your revenue, expenditure and savings for that particular period.

The graph at the bottom will also change showing you your trends for the last three time periods; the green line represents your revenue while the red one represents your expenditure.

<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartToday.jpg" alt="Today" width="200"/>
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartThisWeek.jpg" alt="Today" width="200"/>
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartThisMonth.jpg" alt="Today" width="200"/>
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartThisYear.jpg" alt="Today" width="200"/>

&nbsp;

ðŸ’¡ When you open your application, the default for the time period will always be on All-time! 
</p>

### Choose your category

Next to the Income button, there's a category list that allows you to view the trend for a particular transaction category. 

ðŸ’¡ When you open your application, the default for the transaction category will always be none, which shows your revenue and expenditure trends instead.

<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartCategories.jpg" alt="Today" width="200"/>
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartFoodThisYear.jpg" alt="Choose Food" width="200"/>
</p>

ðŸ’¡ The time period option also affects the category bar chart. The above picture shows the spending on food for that particular year.

If you change the time period again, this graph will also change.

<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartFoodThisMonth.jpg" alt="Food Month" width="200"/>
<img src="UserGuideImages/StartFoodThisWeek.jpg" alt="Food Week" width="200"/>

</p>

### Third page

Pressing any category buttons should show you a list of transactions belonging to that category only. Each item in the list contains a description field, an amount field and a date of occurrence field.
<p align="center">
<img src="UserGuideImages/ShowList.jpg" alt="List items" width="200"/>
</p>

There's also a dropdown list on the toolbar for time periods
ðŸ’¡ When your list is opened, the default for the time period will always be on All-time! 

Changing the time period will then filter the current list and display a filtered one.

<img src="UserGuideImages/ListThisWeek.jpg" alt="List Week" width="200"/>
