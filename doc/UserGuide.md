</p>

### Choose your time period

If you need to look at how much money you saved during a particular time period, just choose it. You will see your revenue, expenditure and savings for that particular period.

The graph at the bottom will also change showing you your trends for the last three time periods; the green line represents your revenue while the red one represents your expenditure.

<p align="center">
